# The Experiment Project

## Description

This is an open-source foundation of a collaborative platform for
aggregating self-experiments across large populations.  More technical
information on the vanilla [Github
Pages](http://eslick.github.com/experiment/)

This system will serve as a test platform for collaborative creation
and editing of experiments, collaborative reviews, and discussion of
experiment execution (see also [Quantified
Self](http://quantifiedself.org)).  It may also serve as an evaluation
platform for an experiment/treatment recommendation engine and
features of the [C3N Project Portal](http://c3nproject.org), a
platform supporting clinical N:1 experiments.

This project was supported in part by [Lybba](http://lybba.org), [C3NProject](http://c3nproject.org), and the [MIT Media Laboratory](http://www.media.mit.edu/).
