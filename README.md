# The Experiment Project

This is an open-source foundation of a collaborative platform for
aggregating self-experiments across large populations, deployed at
[PersonalExperiments.org](http://personalexperiments.org).  More
technical information on the vanilla [Github
Pages](http://eslick.github.com/experiment/)

This system will serve as a test platform for collaborative creation
and editing of experiments, collaborative reviews, and discussion of
experiment execution (see also [Quantified
Self](http://quantifiedself.org)).  It may also serve as an evaluation
platform for an experiment/treatment recommendation engine and
features of the [C3N Project Portal](http://c3nproject.org), a
platform supporting clinical N:1 experiments.
