Template
-----------------

What are you trying to improve?  (Outcome Variable)
How will you measure or track this? (Instrument)

What is your treatment / treatment protocol? (Treatment)
Describe a schedule for treatment
	 - How long to try treatment before seeing an effect
	 - How long to measure the effect
	 - If the treatment is removed, how long before you return to your prior state?
	 - How many cycles of treatment / baseline

What co-variates would you want to track to identify common 'influencers' of your outcome measure?

How will you know if the treatment 'works'?

What factors might predict (based on your reading) why this treatment works?  What questions would you or a doctor ask to decide whether to try this experiment?


Advanced:
  Controls?  Blinding, etc.
  Means of analysis?


Questionnaire
-----------------

1) Would you consider running any one of these experiments in your own life?
2) If yes, which treatments are of interest to you?
3) Describe how a study may be 'counfounded' and at least one way in which you can avoid or work around confounding factors.
4) What is a "wash-out" period and why is it important?
5) Please describe your experience filling out the templates (easy, hard, why?)
6) What did you find difficult to do or understand?
7) Do you have any feedback on the user-interface?  What would make it easier to use?
8) What information did you want to enter for which there werer no fields?
